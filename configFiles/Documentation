  				hsa to be in a server block

  Other rules
  After a location block we can only open another location block or close the server, so if you want to set
  default settings for the default root do it before any location block. f.e. this is not allowed

  server {
  	...
  	location {
  		...
	}
  	index no.html; <---- this is an error, should be before the location block
  }
